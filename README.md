Background Color Changer is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to change the background color of a webpage when certain actions, such as start and stop, are triggered. It's a great example of how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) with JavaScript and apply CSS styles dynamically.


Features⚙️:

🚀 Start Button: Changes the background color to a predefined color when clicked.

🛑 Stop Button: Changes the background color to another predefined color when clicked, effectively stopping at that color.

Technologies Used🌐:

🌐 HTML: Provides the structure of the web page.

🎨 CSS: Used for styling the web page, including the buttons and background.

🛠️ JavaScript: Handles the logic for changing the background color on start and stop actions.
